# TIDE-analysis: Temporal Internal Dimension Exploration

## Empirical AI Architecture Analysis Based on Neuroscience Research

TIDE-analysis automates the detection and measurement of cognitive processing patterns in AI systems using dimensional frameworks validated in fMRI studies. This tool empirically tests how different AI models employ distinct reasoning architectures - similar to neurodiversity differences observed in human cognition.

## 🧠 Scientific Foundation

Based on Hillary Danan's PhD dissertation research identifying 14 semantic features that differentiate processing patterns in autism spectrum and neurotypical populations. This framework has been adapted to measure analogous architectural differences in AI systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
chmod +x quick_start.sh
./quick_start.sh
```

Configure your API keys in `.env`:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-key

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
```

Test connections and run analysis:
```bash
python test_connection.py
python tide_automation.py
```

## 📊 What This Measures

### Dimensional Processing Analysis
- **Internal**: Social, emotional, and self-referential reasoning patterns
- **External**: Spatial, temporal, and numerical processing approaches  
- **Concrete**: Sensory and perceptual information handling

### Architectural Metrics
- Pattern coherence scores (0-100%)
- Dimensional shift frequencies
- Processing pathway evolution (CCDF → CCDR transitions)
- Cross-model architectural comparisons

### Empirical Outputs
- **Automated Reports**: HTML summaries with statistical analysis
- **3D Visualizations**: Interactive exploration of processing patterns
- **Comparative Data**: JSON datasets for further research
- **Pattern Evolution**: Tracking architectural changes over interactions
